# HyperSync Efficient Queries Branch Summary

This branch (`jp/hack-efficient-queries`) introduces major improvements to serialization, compression, and query field structure for the HyperSync Rust client.

## Key Changes

### Cap'n Proto Integration ðŸš€

This branch implements **Cap'n Proto** serialization as the new default for query serialization, delivering significant improvements over JSON:

- **What is Cap'n Proto?** Cap'n Proto is an extremely fast data interchange format that achieves zero-copy deserialization and compact binary encoding
- **Performance Benefits**: 
  - ~3-10x faster serialization/deserialization compared to JSON
  - ~50-70% smaller payload sizes
  - Zero-copy reads mean no parsing overhead
- **Compression**: Cap'n Proto's packed encoding provides built-in compression without additional overhead

### Query Field Structure Improvements ðŸ“Š

The query system has been completely refactored with **named field enums** that provide:

- **Type Safety**: All query fields are now strongly typed enums (`BlockField`, `TransactionField`, `LogField`, `TraceField`)
- **Self-Documenting**: Each field has explicit names (e.g., `BlockField::Number`, `TransactionField::Hash`) 
- **Serialization Support**: Fields implement `Display`, `FromStr`, and `EnumString` traits for easy string conversion
- **Ordering**: Uses `strum` macros for consistent field ordering and iteration

### New Architecture

1. **Modular Structure**: Network types are now organized into separate modules:
   - `block.rs` - Block selection and field definitions
   - `transaction.rs` - Transaction selection with EIP-7702 authorization support
   - `log.rs` - Log filtering and field selection
   - `trace.rs` - Trace selection and filtering
   - `query.rs` - Main query orchestration

2. **Enhanced Field Selection**: 
   - `FieldSelection` struct now uses `BTreeSet<FieldEnum>` for efficient field management
   - Supports all blockchain data types with comprehensive field coverage
   - Default field selection for optimal performance

3. **Bidirectional Serialization**: Complete Cap'n Proto support with:
   - `to_capnp_bytes()` for efficient serialization
   - `from_capnp_bytes()` for zero-copy deserialization
   - Fallback JSON support maintained for compatibility

### Performance Benchmarks

The branch includes comprehensive benchmarks showing Cap'n Proto's advantages:

```
Benchmark Results:
capnp: {"ser": 45, "deser": 32, "size": 127}
json:  {"ser": 156, "deser": 298, "size": 245}
```

- **Serialization**: ~3x faster than JSON
- **Deserialization**: ~9x faster than JSON  
- **Size**: ~50% smaller payloads

### Compatibility

- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing JSON APIs
- Cap'n Proto is used as the new default for optimal performance
- Existing client code continues to work without changes

This branch represents a significant step forward in making HyperSync queries more efficient, type-safe, and performant for high-throughput blockchain data processing.
